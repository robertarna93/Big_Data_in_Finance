# Big_Data_in_Finance
Final project for the module Big Data in Finance - MSc Business Analytics

This project had only two requirements, to include something finance related and to implement some machine learning algorithms. The end solution was a mixture of older economic principles and new machine learning methods. This seems to give excellent results but is yet to be tested on live market environment.

Majority of the code is written in Jupyter notebooks because of the convenience for project submission.

# Explanation of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts

* pre_process: notebook used to download and process stock data into the daily returns data frame.
* plot_EF: notebook used to plot up the efficient frontier. It was used to determine the maximum variance for the portfolio optimisation.
* final_project: notebook that includes the prediction of validation and test returns, portfolio optimisation and the final return plots.
* SVRtrain: Python script used to tune hyper parameters with cloud computing.
